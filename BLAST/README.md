Example of how to create a databse from fasta file 


longestORF.sh

Finds longest open reading frame (ORF)


blastPep.sh

Aligns ORFs to SwissProt


pfamScan.sh

## Methods

BLAST is a tool used to find regions of similarity between sequences. Similarity allows inferences to be made about structure and function of unknown sequences. 
Transdecoder is a protein prediction program to identify coding regions with mRNA sequences and uses protein domains from hmmscan and blast hits as inputs.
