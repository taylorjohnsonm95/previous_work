## Script 1

calc_daltons.py

## Description

This program reads a file and counts the number of amino acids. It then calculates the molecular weight in kilodaltons. 

## Script 2

calc_number_amino_acids.py

## Description

This program asks the user for the length of a DNA sequence to calculate the weight in kilodaltons.If the input is not divisible by 3 the program will exit.

## Script 3 

dynamic_protocol.py

## Description

This program asks the user for a final volume and stock and final concentrations of  NaCl and MgCl2. 
The volume for NaCl and MgCl2 to be added to a solution are then computed. 

## Script 4

descriptive_statistics.py 

## Description

This program opens a data file and stores the numbers from a chosen column into a list. It then computes the count, vaidnum, average, max, min, variance, 
standard deviation and median of this list of numbers. 

## Script 5

./pdb_fasta_splitter.py --infile ss.txt

## Description

Splits a fasta file into header and seq lists. It then appends primary structures with headers to a file and secondary structures
with  headers to another file

## Script 6

./nucleotide_statistics_from_fasta.py --infile influenza.fasta --outfile influenza.stats.txt

## Description

Splits a fasta file. It appends nucleotide stats such as count, length, gc content and accession number to a new file.
